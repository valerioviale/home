The project has been created as a clone of thinkifick using Bootstrap.
For the back end part I am using Node.js to connect to a MongoDB server (Atlas).
To manage registration and autentication I am using express.
You can see a static version on GitHub Pages:
https://github.com/valerioviale/home/settings/pages
Now is possible to register and LogIn.
Next step to give different contents to registered users and non registered users.
Then I will add a payment system to buy courses.
